        <p>
            34 Days Until Graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
           As I enter week 13 of my final semester, I’ve been taking a step back to truly take it all in. Everything
            I’ve accomplished so far has shaped me into who I am today, and I’m grateful for every challenge, lesson,
            and opportunity along the way. Right now, I’m slowing down a bit, not rushing to the finish line, but
            instead choosing to enjoy these last moments: my campus, my friends, my work, my projects, and my life.
            I’m not uncertain about where my path is headed after college, I’m excited for both the known and the unknown.
            Looking back at where I was this time last year, I see growth, resilience, and purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I prepare for this next chapter, I look forward to continuing to grow personally and professionally, and
            to give back as a mentor to my alma mater and my fraternity, just as others have done for me. Here’s to new
            beginnings, continued blessings, and all that’s yet to come.

        <h3>Entry #4 — September 2025</h3>
        <p>
            As my summer comes to a close, I’ve been reflecting on the incredible hands-on experience I’ve gained
            as an IT Infrastructure Intern at Transcard. Over the past few months, I’ve had the opportunity to work
            closely with a talented team who have been instrumental in my growth. My role enabled me to delve deeply
            into enterprise IT systems and the operational aspects of IT, including supporting users, IT asset
            management, and enhancing system reliability. This internship has strengthened my technical foundation
            and given me a real-world understanding of how IT infrastructure supports business operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the highlights include: Remediating vulnerabilities across frequently used applications, helping
            reduce risk and improve performance. Automating patching routines to streamline security updates and
            reduce manual overhead. Providing IT support for hardware and software issues, assisting with onboarding,
            and maintaining IT asset management.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am incredibly grateful for the numerous enjoyable experiences that made this summer truly unforgettable.
            From the exciting Intern outings, such as the Nashville SC game at GEODIS Park, to our memorable Internship
            Farewell Dinner at 2nd American, every moment was filled with joy. The positive, welcoming environment in the
            office made every day enjoyable, not to mention how great the space looks and feels to work in! I'm excited to
            share that I will be returning to my role as an IT Infrastructure Intern for the Fall 2025 semester! I'm looking
            forward to continuing to grow, contribute, and take on new challenges with the IT Infrastructure team.

        <h3>Entry #3 — September 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I've been asked Why I Founded My Fraternity Chapter and How Joining Lambda Theta Phi Changed My Life.
            Before I was a brother, I was coasting through college with no worries and no responsibilites.
        </p>
        <p>
            That changed the moment I was presented with the opportunity to potentially become a Founding Brother 
            of the Epsilon Beta chapter at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. I didn’t just want to join
            a brotherhood and do nothing with it, I wanted to commit myself to transform and grow as a man.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started showing up and being intentional. I put time into meeting many different brothers from many
            different backgrounds, learning from them, and building connections. I got my first job on campus and
            gained responsibilities. After crossing into the brotherhood, I wanted to continue challenging myself
            and ran for leadership. I was elected President of our newly founded chapter. I improved in my role,
            developed strong professional relationships, met new friends, and stepped up into more student
            ambassador roles. My resume started to grow and I could feel myself personally grow. I gained confidence.
            I started applying for scholarships I’d usually pass up, and became an HSF Scholar and received multiple awards.
        </p>
        <p>
            My chapter dedicated ourselves towards serving our community both on campus and off campus. With our
            combined teamwork and effort, we were honored with a Proclamation from the City of Chattanooga,
            recognizing our dedication towards service and uplifting our community. I took my professional
            development more seriously and became a IT Help Desk Technician at my campus IT department and became
            an ambassador for the UTC College of Engineering and Computer Science, where I gained valuable
            experience in technical support and customer service.
        </p>
        <p>
            I leaned into campus resources, joined my college’s Career Center email list, signed up for a LinkedIn
            review, and got paired with Matt Solima from Transcard. That connection opened the door to a job shadowing
            opportunity with the IT Security team, and later, an internship at Transcard with the IT Infrastructure team,
            all because I stepped out of my comfort zone at the career fair and reintroduced myself to the Transcard team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I’m here. None of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t taken that first step. Founding the Epsilon Beta chapter
            of Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc. was more than just bringing a fraternity to campus, it was about taking
            ownership of my life, choosing growth over comfort, and building something from the ground up, for myself, my
            brothers, and future Latino students searching for purpose and a place to belong. If you’re feeling stuck, this is
            your sign: Take one step. Get involved. Be intentional. You never know how far it can take you!

        <h3>Entry #2 — April 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I am pleased to share that I joined Transcard as an IT Infrastructure Intern for the summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m excited for the opportunity to work alongside a talented team supporting and strengthening
            the systems that power innovative financial solutions. I look forward to expanding my technical
            skills, gaining hands-on experience in the fintech space, and learning how IT infrastructure
            enables secure and scalable growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m especially thankful to Matt Solima for his guidance and support throughout this process.
            I truly appreciate the time and effort he invested in helping me along the way.

        <h3>Entry #1 — December 2024</h3>
        <p>
            I accepted a position within the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga’s IT Department
            as an IT Help Desk Technician — my first professional role in IT.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entering my senior year, this opportunity was pivotal in breaking into the IT field
            and building foundational experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was able to supported approximately 11,000 students, 728 faculty/staff, and 35,000 alumni.
            I troubleshot hardware, software, and networking issues across Windows and macOS systems.
            I provided phone and remote support in a fast-paced academic environment.
            I assisted with password resets, email configuration, and access to university systems.
            I communicated technical solutions clearly to users of all experience levels.
