        <h3>Entry #1 - December 2024</h3>
        <p>
            I am pleased to share that I have accepted a position within the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's IT Department as a IT Help Desk Technician. <br>

            This is my first IT role and after entering my senior year of college, this was much needed for breaking into the IT space. <br>
            I learned so much about supporting end users and problem solving technical issues. <br>
            I provided technical support for ~11,000 students, 728 faculty/staff, and 35,000 alumni in a fast-paced academic environment. <br>
            I troubleshot hardware, software, and networking issues across Windows and macOS platforms via phone, and through remote support tools. <br>
            I guided users through password resets, email configuration, and access to university systems such as UTC Learn and Office 365. <br>
            I delivered excellent customer service by clearly communicating technical information to users of all experience levels.
