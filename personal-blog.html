        <h3>Entry #2 - March 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I am pleased to share that I will be joining Transcard this summer as an IT Infrastructure Intern. <br>
            
            I’m excited for the opportunity to work alongside a talented team to support and strengthen the systems that power innovative financial solutions.
            I look forward to expanding my technical skills, gaining hands-on experience in the Fintech space, and learning how IT infrastructure enables secure and scalable growth. <br>
            
            A big thank you to Matt Solima for your guidance and support throughout this process, I truly appreciate the time and effort you took to help me along the way.
