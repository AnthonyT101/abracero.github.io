        <h3>Entry #1 - December 2024</h3>
        <p>
            I am pleased to share that I have accepted a position within the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's IT Department as a IT Help Desk Technician. <br>
            <br><br>
            This is my first IT role and after entering my senior year of college, this was much needed for breaking into the IT space. <br>
            
            I learned so much about supporting end users and problem solving technical issues. <br>
            I provided technical support for ~11,000 students, 728 faculty/staff, and 35,000 alumni in a fast-paced academic environment. <br>
            I troubleshot hardware, software, and networking issues across Windows and macOS platforms via phone, and through remote support tools. <br>
            I guided users through password resets, email configuration, and access to university systems such as UTC Learn and Office 365. <br>
            I delivered excellent customer service by clearly communicating technical information to users of all experience levels.

        <h3>Entry #2 - April 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I am pleased to share that I joined Transcard for this summer as an IT Infrastructure Intern. <br>

            I’m excited for the opportunity to work alongside a talented team to support and strengthen the systems that power innovative financial solutions.
            I look forward to expanding my technical skills, gaining hands-on experience in the Fintech space, and learning how IT infrastructure enables secure and scalable growth. <br>

            Thankful for Matt Solima for his guidance and support throughout this process, I truly appreciate the time and effort he took to help me along the way.
