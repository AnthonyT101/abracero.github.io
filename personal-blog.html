        <h3>Entry #3 — September 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I've been asked Why I Founded My Fraternity Chapter and How Joining Lambda Theta Phi Changed My Life.
            Before I was a brother, I was coasting through college with no worries and no responsibilites.
        </p>
        <p>
            That changed the moment I was presented with the opportunity to potentially become a Founding Brother 
            of the Epsilon Beta chapter at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. I didn’t just want to join
            a brotherhood and do nothing with it, I wanted to commit myself to transform and grow as a man.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started showing up and being intentional. I put time into meeting many different brothers from many
            different backgrounds, learning from them, and building connections. I got my first job on campus and
            gained responsibilities. After crossing into the brotherhood, I wanted to continue challenging myself
            and ran for leadership. I was elected President of our newly founded chapter. I improved in my role,
            developed strong professional relationships, met new friends, and stepped up into more student
            ambassador roles. My resume started to grow and I could feel myself personally grow. I gained confidence.
            I started applying for scholarships I’d usually pass up, and became an HSF Scholar and received multiple awards.
        </p>
        <p>
            My chapter dedicated ourselves towards serving our community both on campus and off campus. With our
            combined teamwork and effort, we were honored with a Proclamation from the City of Chattanooga,
            recognizing our dedication towards service and uplifting our community. I took my professional
            development more seriously and became a IT Help Desk Technician at my campus IT department and became
            an ambassador for the UTC College of Engineering and Computer Science, where I gained valuable
            experience in technical support and customer service.
        </p>
        <p>
            I leaned into campus resources, joined my college’s Career Center email list, signed up for a LinkedIn
            review, and got paired with Matt Solima from Transcard. That connection opened the door to a job shadowing
            opportunity with the IT Security team, and later, an internship at Transcard with the IT Infrastructure team,
            all because I stepped out of my comfort zone at the career fair and reintroduced myself to the Transcard team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I’m here. None of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t taken that first step. Founding the Epsilon Beta chapter
            of Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc. was more than just bringing a fraternity to campus, it was about taking
            ownership of my life, choosing growth over comfort, and building something from the ground up, for myself, my
            brothers, and future Latino students searching for purpose and a place to belong. If you’re feeling stuck, this is
            your sign: Take one step. Get involved. Be intentional. You never know how far it can take you!

        <h3>Entry #2 — April 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I am pleased to share that I joined Transcard as an IT Infrastructure Intern for the summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m excited for the opportunity to work alongside a talented team supporting and strengthening
            the systems that power innovative financial solutions. I look forward to expanding my technical
            skills, gaining hands-on experience in the fintech space, and learning how IT infrastructure
            enables secure and scalable growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m especially thankful to Matt Solima for his guidance and support throughout this process.
            I truly appreciate the time and effort he invested in helping me along the way.

        <h3>Entry #1 — December 2024</h3>
        <p>
            I accepted a position within the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga’s IT Department
            as an IT Help Desk Technician — my first professional role in IT.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entering my senior year, this opportunity was pivotal in breaking into the IT field
            and building foundational experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was able to supported approximately 11,000 students, 728 faculty/staff, and 35,000 alumni.
            I troubleshot hardware, software, and networking issues across Windows and macOS systems.
            I provided phone and remote support in a fast-paced academic environment.
            I assisted with password resets, email configuration, and access to university systems.
            I communicated technical solutions clearly to users of all experience levels.
